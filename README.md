# IoT Device Manager

## Summary

The goal of this project is to create an app that can control various kinds of IoT devices. The starting point is simply to get the app to the point that it can publish MQTT messages to control my sprinkler system. Long term, it would probably be a good idea to define the device interfaces within the app itself, but in the short term, I'll just be defining the various messages within the code itself (much simpler at this point).
